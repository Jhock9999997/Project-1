# Project-1
In this project I took on the role of a network administrator to investigate the situation, analyze the potential cause, suggest solutions, and outline the limitations of the solution. At the end I provided a detailed report on my findings. 

#Scenario
As a network administrator working for XYZ company, your manager has received reports that the company’s website is not working. Users attempting to access the website report that they receive a ‘page cannot be displayed’ error in their browser. Your manager asks you to investigate the situation, analyse the potential cause or causes of the website service disruption, suggest solutions, and outline the limitations of the solution. They have also asked that you provide a detailed report of your findings.
You have begun to look into the situation and confirm the interrupted service issue by visiting the website from your browser—the error message is displayed. Following this, you decide to perform some basic troubleshooting. You attempt to visit the website using the IP address 192.168.170.8 directly with no success.
Based on this preliminary investigation, you suspect that there may be a problem with the Web Server and you determine that the server has been subject to some form of attack. You investigate further so that you understand what happened and can suggest appropriate solutions.
